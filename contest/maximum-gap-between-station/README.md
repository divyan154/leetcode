4026 - Maximum Gap Between Stations

You are given two strings skill and station of lengths n and m, respectively.

skill[i] represents the skill of worker i, and station[j] represents the skill supported by station j.

You must assign every worker to a distinct station. Let ji be the index of the station assigned to worker i. A valid assignment must satisfy:

station[ji] == skill[i] for every 0 <= i < n.
The assigned station indices must be strictly increasing in worker order, meaning j0 < j1 < ... < jn - 1.
The gap of an assignment is the maximum difference between the station indices assigned to two consecutive workers. In other words, it is max(ji - ji - 1) over all 1 <= i < n.

If there is only one worker, the gap is 0.

Return the maximum possible gap among all valid assignments. It is guaranteed that at least one valid assignment exists.
